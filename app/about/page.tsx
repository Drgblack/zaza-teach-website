            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              At Zaza Teach, we believe that teaching is one of the most important professions in the world. 
              Yet teachers are often overwhelmed by administrative tasks and lesson preparation that takes away 
              from what they do best - inspiring and educating students.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Our mission is to give teachers back their time, energy, and passion for teaching by providing 
              AI-powered tools that handle the heavy lifting of lesson planning, allowing educators to focus 
              on what truly matters - their students.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Zaza Teach was founded by educators who experienced firsthand the challenges of modern teaching. 
              After countless late nights spent preparing lessons and the constant struggle to balance quality 
              education with administrative demands, we knew there had to be a better way.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              By combining our deep understanding of pedagogy with cutting-edge AI technology, we created 
              tools that understand what teachers need - practical, curriculum-aligned, and easily customizable 
              lesson plans that maintain the human touch education requires.
